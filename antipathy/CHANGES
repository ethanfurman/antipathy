0.83.00
=======

add ospath support
path operations return actual (destination) path used when possible
partial pathlib support (mostly in naming of properties)

BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE
-----------------------------
the `Path.path` property, which returned the first half of `os.path.split(),
has been renamed to `Path.parent` (alias: `Path.dirname`) for compatibility
with the new pathlib where .path is the entire thing.


0.82.06
=======

add support for Marshalling as either bytes or unicode


0.82.05
=======

fixed path fusion to keep embedded .. directories so long as the root
diectory is not exceeded (if it is in the path)


0.82.04
=======

path fusion (*) now considers all of first argument to be path

  Path('/usr/home/ethan') * Path('../michael') == Path('/usr/home/michael')


0.82.02
=======

add Path.ascend() and Path.descend() to iterate towards or away from /


0.82.01
=======

Path().path is now the same as Path().dirs


0.82.00
=======

Path().dirs no longer has trailing slash on non-root directories; i.e.

  Path('/').dirs == '/'
  Path('/home/ethan/.bashrc').dirs == '/home/ethan'


0.81.08
=======

fix issue in Path.walk: changes to dirs and files now propagate
correctly


0.81.06
=======

allow bytes/unicode mix in Py2 code; add 'set_py3_mode()' to disallow
bytes/unicode mix

move code from __init__ to path, and import back into __init__; this
makes profiling more informative


0.81.00
=======

converted from `path` module to `antipathy` package
added CHANGES, LICENSE, and README files
