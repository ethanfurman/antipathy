add support for Marshalling as either bytes or unicode


0.82.05

fixed path fusion to keep embedded .. directories so long as the root
diectory is not exceeded (if it is in the path)

path fusion (*) now considers all of first argument to be path

add Path.ascend() and Path.descend() to iterate towards or away from /

Path().path is now the same as Path().dirs

Path().dirs no longer has trailing slash on non-root directories; i.e.

0.81.08
=======

fix issue in Path.walk: changes to dirs and files now propagate
correctly
